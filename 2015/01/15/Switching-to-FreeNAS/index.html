        <p>I’ve been running a little short on storage space lately, so I decided to take the plunge and order a new storage system. Previously I was using a Synology DS413 with four 3TB Hitachi disks and I was hoping to get a Synology again for my new system, however once you want a Synology unit with more than four bays the price goes up quite significantly.</p>
<p>After a lot of research and reviewing of similar builds, I ended up with the following components.</p>
<h3 id="Component-List"><a href="#Component-List" class="headerlink" title="Component List"></a>Component List</h3><ul>
<li><p><strong>Case - Fractal Design Node 304</strong></p>
<p>  This case fits six drives, a Mini-ITX motherboard and a standard ATX power supply. Cable management is quite difficult however the entire case is less than 20L in size which is only marginally larger than my existing Synology unit.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Motherboard - ASRock E3C224D2I</strong></p>
<p>  Unfortunately there isn’t much choice when it comes to server-grade Mini-ITX motherboards, however this one fits the specifications quite nicely. It has six SATA ports (2 x SATA2, 4 x SATA3), two ECC DDR3 slots, a BMC chip and two Intel GBe ports. The other option was an Atom Avoton C2550 motherboard however I wasn’t too keen on a non-upgradable CPU and using a Marvell storage controller over an Intel one.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>CPU - Intel Core i3-4160</strong></p>
<p>  Surprisingly, the Core i3 supports ECC RAM! I was originally going to get the Core i3-4150 however this model was on sale and ended up being cheaper.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Memory - Kingston KVR13E9K2/16I</strong></p>
<p>  After reading lots of stories of incompatible memory, I decided to go with RAM sticks that somebody else had tested. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Power Supply - Corsair CX600M Modular</strong></p>
<p>  80+ Bronze certified and six SATA power connectors. I would have rathered an 80+ Gold certified power supply but the price difference was too great.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>OS Disk - SanDisk Cruzer Fit 16GB</strong></p>
<p>  A nice and small USB key that can be installed directly on to the motherboard.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Storage Disks - 6 x Western Digital Red 6TB WD60EFRX</strong></p>
<p>  Originally I was going to order Western Digital Green 6TB WDEZRX drives and run WDIDLE3 on them to fix the LCC issue, however I found that the two models were fairly close in price and the Reds have a longer warranty.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>OS - FreeNAS</strong></p>
<p>  For the OS, I chose FreeNAS after reading a lot about ZFS. The drives are configured in a RAID-Z2 configuration (similar to RAID6) which can tolerate two disk failures. This gives me 36TB of raw storage and 21.8TB of usable storage.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Performance"><a href="#Performance" class="headerlink" title="Performance"></a>Performance</h3><p>To test performance, I had two panes open in <code>tmux</code> and ran one command in each window:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pane 1: <code>iozone -a -s 24g -r 4096 -+w 1 -+y 1 -+C 1</code></li>
<li>Pane 2: <code>zpool iostat 1</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Watching the <code>zpool iostat</code> output whilst iozone was running, I saw that my maximum read speed was around 550-600 MB/s  and my maximum write speed was around 300-350 MB/s.</p>
<h3 id="Thoughts"><a href="#Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Thoughts"></a>Thoughts</h3><p>The next upgrade will be 10gbit networking, however this is a long way off and not really needed at the moment. With a switch upgrade I will be able to use teaming but there is generally only one client accessing the server at once which negates this.</p>
